        <p class="lead mb-4">My calisthenics profession can be written in a short story. In the blink of an eye, my turn is up. I grip the bar harder than ever before, sweating from my head to my toe. My dangling feet, shaking from terror and the burst of excitement consuming me exponentially. Off I go into the air, propelling my body using my core. My mind is free and I forget about the competition. This is the definition of fun. It felt as if my strength was restored and that maybe, just maybe, God was holding me up by my waist, keeping me on the pull-up bars, an angel on my shoulder. I felt beautiful. It was one of the most beautiful moments of my life. In the end, I finally realized that winning or losing was not the greatest point of competition. Competition was just an environment to humble myself, challenge myself, and most importantly, to have fun. My calisthenics journey is now soaring and I am constantly getting better. I am willing to train people and have fun while doing so. Helping others along with helping myself, it is such an honor.<br><br>

        I am also a very great elementary caretaker. My position name was Vacation Bible School Instructor. In this occupation, I was leading a group of elementary students to learn about religion and the importance of reverence. I also used my charisma to encourage discussion and participation between young members of a religious organization utilizing extensive leadership skills.I have endured many challenges with dealing with children along with disobedience, horseplay, tantrums, and more. With intensive training from professional caretakers, I have proved to be one of the best care takers of my church, earning the "crew leader of the week" award, an award given to the crew leader that demonstrated the best leadership skills and people skills throughout the week. With these learnt skills, I built the patience to talk to people of most ages including very small children to adults. I am qualified to interact with a wide range of people. 
<br><br>
        I have very great customer service skills from working at California's Great America. I worked as both a ride operator and a lifeguard for three seasons. Some of my job duties as a ride operator was to be ensuring the safety of riders in an amusement park and operating the rides. I also learned how to monitor any signs of potential danger, such as loose straps or other equipment issues. Moreover, I became very skilled in Inspecting devices such as the control panel, providing instructions to riders, making sure patrons are installed safely, and implementing safety procedures. Some of my responsibilities as a lifeguard was keeping watch for people in the water, overseeing activities at aquatic facilities such as the water slides. Most importantly, I was trained very well to enforce all theme park rules, regulations, and policies to ensure the safety of patrons. My customer service skills from my job at Great America give me better people skills to communicate with others and to make other people feel respected.
